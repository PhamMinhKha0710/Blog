I'm **Pham Minh Kha**, a final-year Computer Science student specializing in **Backend Development** with .NET Core and Node.js.

### Experience

Through 5 personal and group projects, I have:
- Built RESTful APIs handling thousands of requests with authentication/authorization
- Designed and optimized databases (SQL Server, MongoDB) from schema design to query optimization
- Implemented caching with Redis reducing 60% database load
- Applied Clean Architecture and SOLID principles for maintainable code
- Deployed with Docker and CI/CD pipelines

### Approach

I focus on code quality, scalability, and best practices. Always analyze requirements before coding, implement comprehensive error handling, and document clearly. Fast learner through documentation and hands-on practice.

### Goal

Seeking Backend Developer Intern or Junior position to work with senior engineers, contribute to production systems, and grow in an environment with code review culture and modern tech stack.
