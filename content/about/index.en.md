Hey there! 👋 I'm **Pham Minh Kha** - a final-year **Computer Science** student with a strong passion for **Backend Development**. My journey started from curiosity about how web applications work, and now I'm constantly learning to become a professional Backend Developer.

### 🎯 **Learning Journey & Growth**

Throughout my 4 years in college, I've not only accumulated knowledge from lectures but also actively learned through **12+ personal and group projects**. From simple APIs at the beginning to more complex systems with **Clean Architecture**, **Microservices**, and **Event-Driven Design** - each project has been a valuable lesson in software engineering.

I started with **.NET Core** and quickly fell in love with how this framework helps build **enterprise-grade** applications with high performance. Later, I expanded to **Node.js** to deepen my understanding of **asynchronous programming** and **microservices architecture**. Through projects, I've also worked with various databases like **SQL Server**, **MongoDB**, **Redis**, and learned how to optimize queries for the best performance.

### 💡 **Philosophy & Approach**

I believe that **code quality** is just as important as features. In every project I work on, I always:

- **Apply SOLID principles** and appropriate **Design Patterns**
- **Write clean, self-documenting code** with clear naming conventions
- **Design RESTful APIs** following best practices
- **Implement proper error handling** and logging
- **Write unit tests** and integration tests when possible
- **Document APIs** with Swagger/OpenAPI

I'm also particularly interested in **system architecture** - how to separate layers, dependency injection, caching strategies, and database optimization. Learning about **Clean Architecture** completely changed how I approach a new project.

### 🚀 **Goals & Aspirations**

I'm seeking an **internship** or **junior backend developer position** where I can:

- **Learn from senior developers** and receive mentoring
- **Contribute to real-world projects** at scale
- **Work in Agile/Scrum environments**
- **Enhance both technical skills** and **soft skills**
- **Become a professional Backend Engineer**

I'm ready to learn new technologies, face challenges, and continuously improve myself every day! 💪
