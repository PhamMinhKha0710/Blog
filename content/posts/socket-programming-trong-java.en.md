## What is a Socket? Let's Imagine Simply!

Have you ever thought about **two computers talking to each other** like two people on a phone call? A socket is that "phone"!

**Simple visualization:**
- **Socket** = Phone jack 🔌
- **IP Address** = Your house number 🏠
- **Port** = Room number in house (port 80 = web room, port 8080 = your server room)
- **Connection** = Phone line connecting both sides

When you visit Facebook:
1. Your machine (Client) "calls" Facebook server (Server)
2. Server "picks up" and both sides start talking
3. You send request "show me newsfeed", server returns data

**In Java**, you only need 2 classes:
- `ServerSocket` - Server uses to "wait for phone to ring"
- `Socket` - Client uses to "make a call" + Server uses to "talk" with each client

## TCP vs UDP: Which Protocol to Choose?

### TCP - Like Registered Mail 📬

**Features:** Slow but certain!

Imagine you send 10 numbered pages from 1-10:
- TCP ensures **recipient will receive all 10 pages, in correct order 1→10**
- If page 5 is lost → TCP automatically **resends**
- If page 7 arrives before page 6 → TCP automatically **reorders**

**When to use TCP?**
- ✅ Chat app (messages can't be lost)
- ✅ File download (file must be 100% complete)
- ✅ Banking app (transactions must be absolutely accurate)

### UDP - Like Shouting Across Street 📢

**Features:** Fast but data can be lost!

Imagine you shout 10 sentences:
- UDP **doesn't care** if the other person hears everything
- **Doesn't resend** if any sentence gets blown away by wind
- **Doesn't guarantee order** - sentence 8 might arrive before sentence 3

**When to use UDP?**
- ✅ Video call, livestream (losing a few frames is okay, smooth is important)
- ✅ Online games (lag 1 frame is acceptable)
- ✅ DNS lookup (small query, resending cheaper than TCP setup)

**In this series, we focus on TCP** because it's more common and easier to learn!

## Building Your First Client-Server Application

### Step 1: Server - Waiting for Phone to Ring 📞

**How it works:**

1. Create ServerSocket(8080) → "I'm waiting at port 8080"
2. accept() → "Waiting... has anyone called yet?"
   - ⏸️ **BLOCKS HERE** - waits forever until client arrives
3. Client connects! → accept() returns new Socket
4. Use this Socket to read/write data with client
5. Close connection → "Hang up"

**Server Code:**

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class SimpleServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int port = 8080;
        
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port)) {
            System.out.println("🚀 Server waiting for connection on port " + port);
            
            while (true) {
                // Wait for client to call (BLOCKING here)
                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
                System.out.println("✅ Client just connected: " + 
                    clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress());
                
                // Read message from client
                BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
                    new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
                String message = in.readLine();
                System.out.println("📩 Received: " + message);
                
                // Reply to client
                PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(
                    clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
                out.println("Server received: " + message);
                
                // Close connection
                clientSocket.close();
                System.out.println("👋 Client disconnected\n");
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("❌ Server error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Line-by-line explanation:**

```java
ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);
// "I'm opening shop at port address 8080"

Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
// "I'm waiting for customers... (blocks here)"
// When customer arrives → returns "phone" to talk

BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(...);
// "Earpiece" - used to LISTEN to what client says

PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(..., true);
// "Microphone" - used to SPEAK to client
// Parameter 'true' = auto-flush (speak and push immediately, don't hold back)
```

---

### Step 2: Client - Making Phone Call 📱

**How it works:**

1. new Socket("localhost", 8080) → "Call server at localhost:8080"
   - ⏸️ **BLOCKS** until connection successful
2. Connection OK! → Have Socket to read/write
3. Send message → "Hello server!"
4. Read response from server
5. Close connection

**Client Code:**

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class SimpleClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String serverAddress = "localhost";
        int port = 8080;
        
        try (Socket socket = new Socket(serverAddress, port)) {
            System.out.println("✅ Connected to server!");
            
            // Send message
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(
                socket.getOutputStream(), true);
            String message = "Hello from Client!";
            out.println(message);
            System.out.println("📤 Sent: " + message);
            
            // Receive response
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
            String response = in.readLine();
            System.out.println("📥 Server replied: " + response);
            
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("❌ Cannot connect: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Try it:**

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Run Server first
java SimpleServer
🚀 Server waiting for connection on port 8080

# Terminal 2 - Run Client
java SimpleClient
✅ Connected to server!
📤 Sent: Hello from Client!
📥 Server replied: Server received: Hello from Client!
```

---

## Problem: Server Can Only Serve 1 Client! 😱

**Try this:**
- Run Client #2 while Client 1 is still connected
- Client 2 must **wait** until Client 1 is done!

**Reason:**
Server has **only 1 thread**:
```
accept() → handle client 1 → close → accept() → handle client 2...
```

Like a coffee shop with only 1 employee:
- Customer A enters → employee makes coffee for A (5 minutes)
- Customers B, C, D must wait outside 😤

**Solution: Multithreading!** (Hire more employees)

---

## Multithreaded Server - Serving Multiple Clients Simultaneously

**Idea:**
- **Main Thread**: Only does 1 thing - `accept()` - greet customers
- **Worker Threads**: Each client gets their own worker thread

**Diagram:**
```
Main Thread:        Worker Threads:
┌─────────┐        ┌──────────────┐
│ accept()│───────→│ Thread 1     │ ← Client A
│    ⬇️    │        │ (read/write)  │
│ accept()│───────→│ Thread 2     │ ← Client B
│    ⬇️    │        │ (read/write)  │
│ accept()│───────→│ Thread 3     │ ← Client C
└─────────┘        └──────────────┘
```

**Multithreaded Server Code:**

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class MultithreadedServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int port = 8080;
        
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port)) {
            System.out.println("🚀 Multithreaded server running...");
            
            while (true) {
                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
                System.out.println("✅ New client connected!");
                
                // Create new thread to handle this client
                ClientHandler handler = new ClientHandler(clientSocket);
                new Thread(handler).start();
                // Main thread immediately goes back to accept() → greet next client!
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("❌ Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    
    // Worker thread - each thread serves 1 client
    private static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {
        private Socket clientSocket;
        
        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {
            this.clientSocket = socket;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try (
                BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
                    new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
                PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(
                    clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
            ) {
                String message;
                // Read continuously until client disconnects
                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {
                    System.out.println("📩 [" + 
                        clientSocket.getInetAddress() + "]: " + message);
                    out.println("Echo: " + message);
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.err.println("Error handling client: " + e.getMessage());
            } finally {
                try {
                    clientSocket.close();
                    System.out.println("👋 Client disconnected");
                } catch (IOException e) {}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main thread** only runs `accept()` loop - lightweight, fast
2. Each time client arrives → **create ClientHandler** (Runnable)
3. **new Thread(handler).start()** → Throw handler to new thread to process
4. Main thread **doesn't wait** for that thread → immediately goes back to `accept()`

**Result:** Server can now serve 10, 100, 1000 clients simultaneously! 🎉

## Real-World Application: Building Chat Server

Now let's do something more interesting - **Chat room** where multiple people can talk to each other!

**Features:**
- Multiple clients connect simultaneously
- When 1 person sends message → **everyone** receives it (broadcast)
- Each person has their own name

### Chat Server - Broadcasting to Everyone

**Main idea:**

Save list of all online clients, when new message arrives send to everyone:

```java
// Save list of all online clients
Set<PrintWriter> allClients = new HashSet<>();

// When new message arrives
void broadcast(String message) {
    for (PrintWriter client : allClients) {
        client.println(message);  // Send to each person
    }
}
```

**Complete code:**

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.*;

public class ChatServer {
    // List of all online clients
    private static Set<PrintWriter> clientWriters = 
        Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int port = 8080;
        
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port)) {
            System.out.println("💬 Chat Server running...");
            
            while (true) {
                new ClientHandler(serverSocket.accept()).start();
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("❌ Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    
    private static class ClientHandler extends Thread {
        private Socket socket;
        private PrintWriter out;
        private String clientName;
        
        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {
            this.socket = socket;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
                    new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
                out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
                
                // Ask client to enter name
                out.println("SUBMITNAME");
                clientName = in.readLine();
                
                if (clientName == null || clientName.trim().isEmpty()) {
                    return;  // Client didn't enter name → kick out
                }
                
                System.out.println("✅ " + clientName + " joined");
                broadcast(clientName + " joined the chat! 👋");
                
                // Add client to list
                clientWriters.add(out);
                
                // Listen for messages
                String message;
                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {
                    if (!message.trim().isEmpty()) {
                        System.out.println("[" + clientName + "]: " + message);
                        broadcast(clientName + ": " + message);
                    }
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
            } finally {
                // Client leaves
                if (clientName != null) {
                    System.out.println("👋 " + clientName + " left the chat");
                    broadcast(clientName + " left the chat");
                }
                if (out != null) {
                    clientWriters.remove(out);
                }
                try { socket.close(); } catch (IOException e) {}
            }
        }
        
        // Send message to ALL clients
        private void broadcast(String message) {
            for (PrintWriter writer : clientWriters) {
                writer.println(message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Chat Client - Simple Interface

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ChatClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String serverAddress = "localhost";
        int port = 8080;
        
        try {
            Socket socket = new Socket(serverAddress, port);
            System.out.println("✅ Connected to Chat Server");
            
            // Thread to read messages from server
            new Thread(new MessageReader(socket)).start();
            
            // Main thread: Read input from keyboard and send
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
            
            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
                String input = scanner.nextLine();
                out.println(input);
            }
            
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("❌ Cannot connect: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    
    // Separate thread to read messages from server
    private static class MessageReader implements Runnable {
        private BufferedReader in;
        private Socket socket;
        
        public MessageReader(Socket socket) {
            this.socket = socket;
            try {
                this.in = new BufferedReader(
                    new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                String message;
                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {
                    if (message.equals("SUBMITNAME")) {
                        // Server asks to enter name
                        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
                        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
                        String name = scanner.nextLine();
                        
                        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(
                            socket.getOutputStream(), true);
                        out.println(name);
                    } else {
                        // Display message
                        System.out.println(message);
                    }
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.err.println("❌ Lost connection!");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Try it:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Server
java ChatServer
💬 Chat Server running...

# Terminal 2: Client A
java ChatClient
✅ Connected to Chat Server
Enter your name: Alice
Alice joined the chat! 👋

# Terminal 3: Client B  
java ChatClient
Enter your name: Bob
Bob joined the chat! 👋

# Alice types:
Hello everyone!
→ Displays in all terminals: "Alice: Hello everyone!"
```

## Important Knowledge: Blocking I/O

**What does "Blocking" mean?**

Imagine you call Pizza Hut:

1. You: "One pizza please"
2. 🔇 **BLOCK** - You hold phone waiting...
3. 🔇 **BLOCK** - Can't do anything, just wait...
4. Pizza Hut: "OK, your order received!"
5. → Now you can hang up and do other things

**In Socket Programming:**

```java
String message = in.readLine();  // BLOCKS HERE!
```

- This line will **freeze** until there's data from client
- Thread can't do anything else!
- If client doesn't send anything → thread "frozen" forever

**Problem with Blocking I/O:**

- Server has 100 threads
- → Can serve maximum 100 clients
- → Client 101 must wait!
- Each thread costs ~1MB RAM → **10,000 clients = 10GB RAM!** 😱

**Solution: Non-Blocking I/O (NIO)** - but much more complex!

---

## Thread Pool - Intelligent Thread Management

**Problem with "thread per client":**

```java
while (true) {
    Socket client = serverSocket.accept();
    new Thread(new Handler(client)).start();  // CREATE NEW THREAD
}
```

If 10,000 clients connect simultaneously:
- Create 10,000 threads → **Massive RAM consumption**
- CPU must switch between 10,000 threads → **Slow**

**Solution: Thread Pool**

Instead of creating new thread each time, we **prepare a group of threads** (e.g., 50 threads):

**Thread Pool Diagram:**
```
Pool has 50 ready threads
┌─────────────────┐
│ T1  T2  T3 ... │  ← Waiting for work
│ T4  T5  T6 ... │
└─────────────────┘
   ↑
   │ New client arrives
   └─ Take 1 idle thread to handle
   
When done → Thread returns to Pool → Reuse for another client
```

**Code with Thread Pool:**

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int port = 8080;
        int threadPoolSize = 50;  // Maximum 50 threads
        
        // Create Thread Pool
        ExecutorService threadPool = 
            Executors.newFixedThreadPool(threadPoolSize);
        
        try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port)) {
            System.out.println("🚀 Server with Thread Pool running...");
            
            while (true) {
                Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
                System.out.println("✅ New client connected");
                
                // Don't create new thread! Use thread from pool
                threadPool.execute(new ClientHandler(clientSocket));
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("❌ Error: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            threadPool.shutdown();  // Shut down pool when server stops
        }
    }
    
    private static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {
        private Socket clientSocket;
        
        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {
            this.clientSocket = socket;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try (
                BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
                    new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
                PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(
                    clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
            ) {
                String message;
                while ((message = in.readLine()) != null) {
                    out.println("Echo: " + message);
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Control thread count → Don't consume excessive RAM
- ✅ Reuse threads → Faster (don't have to create/destroy constantly)
- ✅ Limit load → If have 1000 clients but only 50 threads, only handle 50 at a time

## Java NIO - Non-Blocking I/O (Advanced)

**Problem with Blocking I/O:**

Traditional model: **1 Thread = 1 Client**

```
10,000 clients → Need 10,000 threads → 💀 Server crash
```

**NIO Solution: 1 Thread handles MULTIPLE clients!**

### Idea: Selector (Supervisor)

Imagine you're a delivery person with 100 orders:

**Old way (Blocking I/O):**
```
Hire 100 delivery people, each delivers 1 order
→ Expensive wages!
```

**New way (NIO):**
```
1 delivery person, with smart app:
→ App notifies: "Order #5 is ready to pick up"
→ Delivery person picks order 5, delivers
→ App: "Orders 12 and 37 are ready"
→ Delivery person picks 12 and 37...
```

**In Java NIO:**

```java
Selector selector = Selector.open();  // "Supervisor"

// Register 1000 channels (clients) with selector
for (SocketChannel client : clients) {
    client.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);
}

while (true) {
    // Ask: "Which client has data to read?"
    selector.select();  // BLOCKS until at least 1 client is ready
    
    // Get list of ready clients
    Set<SelectionKey> readyKeys = selector.selectedKeys();
    
    for (SelectionKey key : readyKeys) {
        // Handle each ready client
        if (key.isReadable()) {
            SocketChannel client = (SocketChannel) key.channel();
            // Read data from this client
        }
    }
}
```

**Comparison:**

| Feature | Blocking I/O | Non-Blocking I/O (NIO) |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Threads needed** | 1 thread = 1 client | 1 thread = N clients |
| **Complexity** | ⭐ Simple | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Complex |
| **Scalability** | ❌ Limited (few thousand clients) | ✅ Good (tens of thousands of clients) |
| **When to use** | Most applications | When need >5000 clients |

**Advice:**
- With <1000 clients: Use **Blocking I/O + Thread Pool** (simple, sufficient)
- With >5000 clients: Use **NIO** or framework like **Netty** (more professional)

## Common Errors and Solutions

### 1. ConnectException - "Can't Call"

```java
java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
```

**Causes:**
- Server not running
- Wrong IP or Port
- Firewall blocking connection

**Solution:**

```java
try {
    Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
} catch (ConnectException e) {
    System.err.println("❌ Server not open! Run server first.");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println("❌ Connection error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

### 2. SocketException - "Wire Cut Mid-way"

```java
java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
```

**Causes:**
- Client suddenly disconnects (closes app, loses network)
- Writing to closed socket

**Solution:**

```java
try {
    String message = in.readLine();
    if (message == null) {
        // Client disconnected
        System.out.println("Client exited");
        break;
    }
} catch (SocketException e) {
    System.out.println("Lost connection with client");
    break;
}
```

### 3. What is Auto-flush? Why Important?

**Problem:**

```java
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream());  // MISSING TRUE!
out.println("Hello");
// "Hello" STUCK in buffer, NOT sent!
```

Like writing a letter but **not putting it in mailbox**:

```
You finish writing letter → Leave on desk
Post office doesn't know → Letter doesn't go!
```

**Solution:**

```java
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
//                                                          ^^^^^^ AUTO-FLUSH
out.println("Hello");  
// "Hello" automatically PUSHED to socket immediately!
```

Or call `flush()` manually:

```java
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
out.println("Hello");
out.flush();  // Push data out
```

### 4. Try-with-resources - Automatically Close Resources

**Old way (easy to forget closing socket):**

```java
Socket socket = null;
try {
    socket = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
    // ... work with socket
} finally {
    if (socket != null) {
        socket.close();  // Easy to forget!
    }
}
```

**New way (Java 7+):**

```java
try (Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8080)) {
    // ... work with socket
}  // Socket automatically closes when leaving block!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Don't forget to close socket
- ✅ Code more concise
- ✅ Safer (closes even with exception)

## Summary and Best Practices

### ✅ Socket Programming Checklist

**1. Resource management:**
- ✅ Always use `try-with-resources`
- ✅ Close Socket, Stream when not needed
- ✅ Set timeout to avoid hanging: `socket.setSoTimeout(30000);` (30 seconds)

**2. Error handling:**
- ✅ Catch `ConnectException` on Client
- ✅ Catch `SocketException` when reading/writing
- ✅ Check `readLine() == null` (client disconnected)

**3. Performance:**
- ✅ Use `BufferedReader` instead of reading byte by byte
- ✅ Enable auto-flush for `PrintWriter`
- ✅ For many clients: Use **Thread Pool**

**4. Server Architecture:**

| Number of clients | Recommended architecture |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1-10 | Single-threaded (simplest) |
| 10-1000 | Thread Pool (Executors.newFixedThreadPool) |
| >5000 | Java NIO or Netty Framework |

## Conclusion

Socket Programming in Java can be summarized as:

**1. Core concepts:**
- Socket = "Pipe" connecting 2 computers
- TCP = Ensures data arrives, in correct order
- UDP = Fast but can lose data

**2. Basic code:**
```java
// Server
ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(8080);
Socket client = server.accept();  // Wait for client

// Client  
Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8080);  // Connect

// Read/Write
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(...);   // Read
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(..., true);  // Write
```

**3. Advanced:**
- Use Thread Pool to handle many clients
- Use NIO when need >5000 connections

**4. Most important:**
- ✅ Always close resources (try-with-resources)
- ✅ Handle exceptions properly
- ✅ Enable auto-flush for PrintWriter

Now you understand Socket Programming! Try building your own chat app, file transfer or multiplayer game! 🚀
